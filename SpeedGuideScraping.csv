A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) subsystem in the StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, ASR 5500 Series, ASR 5700 Series devices, and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unrestricted, root shell access. The vulnerability is due to missing input validation of parameters passed during SSH or SFTP login. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted user input to the SSH or SFTP command-line interface (CLI) during SSH or SFTP login. An exploit could allow an authenticated attacker to gain root privileges access on the router. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An established TCP connection toward port 22, the SSH default port, is needed to perform the attack. The attacker must have valid credentials to login to the system via SSH or SFTP. The following products have been confirmed to be vulnerable: Cisco ASR 5000/5500/5700 Series devices running StarOS after 17.7.0 and prior to 18.7.4, 19.5, and 20.2.3 with SSH configured are vulnerable.

Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the EN100 communication module if oscillographs are running. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality. Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the EN100 module. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected EN100 modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system.

W32.Blaster.Worm [Symantec-2003-081113-0229-99] - a widely spread worm that exploits the DCOM RPC vulnerability described above (MS Security Bulletin [MS03-026]). The worm allows remote access to an infected computer via ports 4444/tcp and 69/UDP, and spreads through port 135/tcp. To avoid being infected consider closing those ports.

Port is also used by Messenger Service (not MSN Messenger) and exploited in popup net send messenger spam [MSKB 330904]. To stop the popups you'd need to filter port 135 at the firewall level or stop the messenger service. The service uses all the following ports: 135/tcp, 135/udp, 137/udp 138/udp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp.

W32.Reatle.E@mm [Symantec-2005-080215-5809-99] - a mass-mailing worm that opens a backdoor and also spreads by exploiting the MS DCOM RPC Vulnerability [MS03-026] on port 135/tcp. It uses its own SMTP engine to email itself to gathered email addresses. Opens an FTP server on port 1155/tcp. Opens a proxy server on port 2005/tcp. It also attempts to perform denial of service (DDoS) attack agains known security websites on port 1052/tcp. Note: port 1052 corresponds to the dynamic DNS service.

A vulnerability has been identified in LOGO!8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions). The vulnerability could lead to an attacker reading and modifying the device configuration and obtain project files from affected devices. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to port 135/tcp. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. The vulnerability impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

By default, when File and Print Sharing is enabled it binds to everything, including TCP/IP (The Internet Protocol), rather than just the local network, meaning your shared resources are available over the entire Internet for reading and deletion, unless configured properly. Any machine with NetBIOS enabled and not configured properly should be considered at risk. The best protection is to turn off File and Print Sharing, or block ports 135-139 completely. If you must enable it, use the following guidelines:

1. Use strong passwords, containing non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Attach ""$"" at the end of your share names (the casual snooper using net view might not see them).
3. Unbind File and Print Sharing from TCP/IP and use NetBEUI instead (it's a non-routable protocol).
4. Block ports 135-139 in your router/firewall.

The Auto-Maskin products utilize an undocumented custom protocol to set up Modbus communications with other devices without validating those devices. The originating device sends a message in plaintext, 48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:57:6f:72:6c:64, ""Hello World"" over UDP ports 44444-44446 to the broadcast address for the LAN. Without verification devices respond to any of these broadcast messages on the LAN with a plaintext reply over UDP containing the device model and firmware version. Following this exchange the devices allow Modbus transmissions between the two devices on the standard Modbus port 502 TCP. Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send arbitrary messages to any DCU or RP device through spoofing or replay attacks as long as they have access to the network. Affected releases are Auto-Maskin DCU-210E RP-210E: Versions prior to 3.7 on ARMv7.
